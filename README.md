# ATmega328P

Driver library for basic functionalities of the ATmega328P (Arduino UNO) microcontroller.
 * UART - UART (blocking)
 * UART2 - UART (interrupt based) (uses RING.h)
 * SPI - SPI Master
 * SPI2 - SPI Master (interrupt based)
 * TWI - I2C Master
 * ADC - Analog to digital converter (interrupt based)
 * Servo - Servo driver (interrupt based)
 * ESC - ESC driver (uses Servo.h)
 * PID - PID controller driver (interrupt based)
 * PID2 - PID controller driver with variable frequency (accessible iterate function) (interrupt based)
 * RING - Ring buffer implementation
 * NRF24L01 - NRF24L01 library (blocking) (uses SPI)
 * NRF24L01_Interrupt - NRF24L01 library (interrupt based) (uses SPI)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is written in C and nothing except the standard libraries (avr-libc) are needed.

### Installation

Download this repository and save it somewhere where you can find it later.
Add the repository folder to your include paths and the source files (.c) to your project when compiling.

#### Atmel Studio 7.0

When you created a new project right-click on the project (in the solution explorer) and go to Properties->Toolchain->[Your Compiler]->Directories and add a new directory.
Select this repository in the file chooser and click ok. This lets the compiler find the header files when you include them in your sources.
You also have to add the needed source files to your project (if you use UART.h then you also need to add UART.c). You can add them by right-clicking on the project, go to "Add" and then press "Existing item...".
Now select the source files (.c) and press "Add". (You can also add them as link so it doesn't always copies the whole file to your project directory by pressing "Add as link"
which appears when you click the small downwards facing arrow to the right of the "Add" button in the file chooser)

## Usage

The functions of every module start with the module name in all capitals, followed by an underline and then the function name in camel case formatting. E.g.
```
UART_transmitBurst()
```

Most modules have an init function that needs to be called for every other function to work properly. E.g.
```
UART_init()
```

Also make sure to enable interrupts before calling any function of modules that use interrupts!
